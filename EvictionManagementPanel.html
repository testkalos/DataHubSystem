The Data Eviction Service is responsible for removing data to keep to the  Data Store sizing constraints. The maximum occupied space for each archive depends on theconfiguration.  The administrator can handle the eviction of products through the Eviction panel here below.

						<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Eviction Management panel (GUI)</strong>  
						<p align="justify">The eviction rules are:</p>       
						<p align="justify">1.First In First Out (FIFO);</p>    
						<p align="justify">2.Least Recently Used (LRU).  </p>  
<p align="justify">They can be chose through the drop-down menu named Eviction strategy.   
LFU and LRU are defined using a system of hit points, calculated with the number of searches and downloads for each product.    
The service will log (in the panel on the lower side of the page) any evicted file in the Database and flag the product/entry by removing/updating its Data Store URL that is no longer relevant.   
						</p>
						<p align="justify"><strong>How to activate the archive rolling policy?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">
	In order to activate the eviction, perform the following steps:</p>
						<p align="justify">1. Access the DHuS page:</p>
						<p align="justify">2. Perform the login;</p>
<p align="justify">3. Select the Management Panel and then select the Eviction management  panel;</p>
<p align="justify">4. Select the Eviction strategy (Fig. 23: Eviction panel (GWT GUI)) using the drop-down menu;</p>
<p align="justify">5. Configure the Maximum disk usage before eviction depending on how much of the machine space can be occupied by data before triggering the eviction (e.g. if the parameter is set to 80, when the disk will be full at 80%, the eviction will be automatically activated)</p>
<p align="justify">6. Configure the Minimal keeping period for a product parameter. This parameter represents the number of days each product will be kept in the DHuS archive before being evicted (e.g if the parameter is set to 3, the eviction will delete all the products present in the archive for more than three days.) </p>
