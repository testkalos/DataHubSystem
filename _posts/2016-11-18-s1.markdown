[S1 TOOLBOX ](http://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/sentinel-1-toolbox/ "Sentinel-1 Toolbox")      
The Sentinel-1 Toolbox (S1TBX) consists of a collection of processing tools, data product readers and writers and a display and analysis application to support the large archive of data from ESA SAR missions including SENTINEL-1, ERS-1 & 2 and ENVISAT, as well as third party SAR data from ALOS PALSAR, TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed and RADARSAT-2. The various processing tools could be run independently from the command-line and also integrated within the graphical user interface. The Toolbox includes tools for calibration, speckle filtering, coregistration, orthorectification, mosaicking, data conversion, polarimetry and interferometry.

The Sentinel-1 Toolbox is being developed for ESA by Array Systems Computing in partnership with DLR, Brockmann Consult and OceanDataLab.
