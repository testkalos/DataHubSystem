Once the installation package (see Installation Guide section) has been successfully installed, the DHuS server can be accessed online (https://dhus.xxx.zz) or on local URL (https://localhost/).
To access the administrator panels, it is first necessary to login as root,using the default settings. The button is displayed in the upper right side of the DHuS Home page.

<b><p align ="justify"> Panels description</b> </p>
<p align ="justify">
The DHuS provides the Administrator a series of Panels to fulfil every service. We report here how to access them using the GUI.
The list of panels is provided here below:</p>
<p align="left">
<ol>
<li>Search Panel</li>
<li> Upload Panel</li>
<li>Profile Panel</li>
<li>Cart Panel</li>
<li>Management Panel</li>
<ul>
  <li>Users</li>
  <li>Collections</li>
  <li>Sustem</li>
  <li>Eviction</li>
</ul>
<li>Odata synchronizer Panel</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p  align ="justify">
Once the administrator has logged in, the panels are accessible clicking on the ?user icon? on the upper right side of the page.</p>

<b><p align ="justify">Products Upload</b></p>
<p align ="justify">
The Upload feature is available only to the administrator. DHuS system makes available an incoming space to let the user upload a product. Once uploaded, data is processed to be referenced by DHuS clients. This panel gathers all the information necessary to perform the upload (at least the path to the product).
Optional: Assignation of a product to a collection is manually set by the uploader. A product can be included in any collection.

The DHuS allows the ingestion of Sentinels products using 4 methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ad hoc upload</li>
<li>Creating a file scanner</li>
<li>Synchronizing remote archive</li>
</ul>

<b><p align ="justify">Products upload methods</b></p>

The first two methods are accessible by the upload panel, the third is accesible via a dedicated odata synchronizer panel:

<b><p align ="justify">Ad hoc upload </b></p>
<p align ="justify">
Once in the Upload panel, it is possible to perform the upload of a product: select the input products, then (optiona) select a collection in the list of collections and click on the "Upload" button. The upload will start and at the end of it, a pop up will notify that the upload is over. </p>

<p align ="justify">
Upload via file scanner If the upload has to be periodic, a scanner can be configured with the panel highlighted by the red arrow in figure below.
</p>

To create a file scanner:
<p align ="justify">
Access the upload panel
Fill the Url to scan field with the path of the folder containing the products (if the products are in the same machine where DHuS is installed, the field shall be filled as ?file:///path/of/the/folder?).
If the products are located on an external data provider (accessible via ftp), configure the username and password to access the machine; otherwise the username and passwords will not be necessary.
To upload just specific types of product, configure the ?Pattern? field according to the regular expression roles explained in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html (e.g. "S1[AB]\p{Upper}{2}(SLC|GRDM).*" to upload only the SLC and the GRDM products)
Click on the ?add? button. In the lower part of the page it will be written ?when? the file scanner will be activated again.
</p>

<b><p align ="justify">Upload synchronizing remote archive</b></p>
<p align="justify"> 
The DHuS allows synchronizing products from another DHuS instance. For further details, go to OData Synchronizers panel section.
