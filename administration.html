Once the installation package (see Installation Guide section) has been successfully installed, the DHuS server can be accessed online (https://dhus.xxx.zz) or on local URL (https://localhost/).
To access the administrator panels, it is first necessary to login as root,using the default settings. The button is displayed in the upper right side of the DHuS Home page.

<a href="" class="image left"><img src="assets/images/fig2.jpg" alt="" /></a> 
<b><p align ="justify"> Panels description</b> </p>
<p align ="justify">
The DHuS provides the Administrator a series of Panels to fulfil every service. We report here how to access them using the GUI.
The list of panels is provided here below:</p>
<p align="left">
<ol>
<li>Search Panel</li>
<li> Upload Panel</li>
<li>Profile Panel</li>
<li>Cart Panel</li>
<li>Management Panel</li>
<ul>
  <li>Users</li>
  <li>Collections</li>
  <li>Sustem</li>
  <li>Eviction</li>
</ul>
<li>Odata synchronizer Panel</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p  align ="justify">
Once the administrator has logged in, the panels are accessible clicking on the ?user icon? on the upper right side of the page.</p>

<a href="" class="image left"><img src="assets/images/fig3.jpg" alt="" /></a>  

<b><p align ="justify">Products Upload</b></p>
<p align ="justify">
The Upload feature is available only to the administrator. DHuS system makes available an incoming space to let the user upload a product. Once uploaded, data is processed to be referenced by DHuS clients. This panel gathers all the information necessary to perform the upload (at least the path to the product).
Optional: Assignation of a product to a collection is manually set by the uploader. A product can be included in any collection.

The DHuS allows the ingestion of Sentinels products using 4 methods:</p>
<p>
Ad hoc upload
Creating a file scanner
Synchronizing remote archive
</p>
<a href="" class="image left"><img src="assets/images/fig4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
<b><p align ="justify">Products upload methods</b></p>
The first two methods are accessible by the upload panel, the third is accesible via a dedicated odata synchronizer panel:
<a href="" class="image left"><img src="assets/images/fig5.jpg" alt="" /></a>
<b><p align ="justify">Ad hoc upload </b></p>
<p align ="justify">
Once in the Upload panel, it is possible to perform the upload of a product: select the input products, then (optiona) select a collection in the list of collections and click on the "Upload" button. The upload will start and at the end of it, a pop up will notify that the upload is over. </p>

<a href="" class="image left"><img src="assets/images/fig6.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p align ="justify">
Upload via file scanner If the upload has to be periodic, a scanner can be configured with the panel highlighted by the red arrow in figure below.
</p>

<a href="" class="image left"><img src="assets/images/fig7.jpg" alt="" /></a>
<p align ="justify">
To create a file scanner:
Access the upload panel
Fill the Url to scan field with the path of the folder containing the products (if the products are in the same machine where DHuS is installed, the field shall be filled as ?file:///path/of/the/folder?).
If the products are located on an external data provider (accessible via ftp), configure the username and password to access the machine; otherwise the username and passwords will not be necessary.
To upload just specific types of product, configure the ?Pattern? field according to the regular expression roles explained in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html (e.g. "S1[AB]\p{Upper}{2}(SLC|GRDM).*" to upload only the SLC and the GRDM products)
Click on the ?add? button. In the lower part of the page it will be written ?when? the file scanner will be activated again.
</p>

The DHuS allows synchronizing products from another DHuS instance. For further details, go to OData Synchronizers panel section.

5. Synchronize Local archive :obsolete function, do not use;
</p>
<b>Eviction Management Panel</b>
<p align="justify">
The Data Eviction Service is responsible for removing data to keep to the Data Store sizing constraints. The maximum occupied space for each archive
depends on theconfiguration. The administrator can handle the eviction of products through the Eviction panel here below.
</p>
<a href="" class="image left"><img src="assets/images/fig17.jpg" alt="" /></a>
<b>Eviction Management panel (GUI)</b>
<p align="justify">The eviction rules are:
First In First Out (FIFO)
Least Recently Used (LRU)
They can be chose through the drop-down menu named ?Eviction strategy?.
LFU and LRU are defined using a system of ?hit points?, calculated with the number of searches and downloads for each product.
The service will log (in the panel on the lower side of the page) any evicted file in the Database and flag the product/entry by removing/updating its Data Store URL that is no longer relevant.
</p>

<b>How to activate the archive rolling policy?</b>
<p align="justify" >In order to activate the eviction, perform the following steps:
Access the DHuS page
Perform the login
Select the Management Panel and then select the Eviction management panel
Select the Eviction strategy using the drop-down menu
Configure the ?Maximum disk usage before eviction? depending on how much of the machine space can be occupied by data before triggering the eviction (e.g. if the parameter is set to 80, when the disk will be full at 80%, the eviction will be automatically activated)</
i>Configure the ?Minimal keeping period for a product? parameter. This parameter represents the number of days each product will be kept in the DHuS archive before being evicted (e.g if the parameter is set to 3, the eviction will delete all the products present in the archive for more than three days.)
</li>
<b>OData Synchronizers panel</b>
<p align="justify"> 
The OData synchronizers panel is available just in the AJS GUI. The DHuS provides end users an OData synchronizer service able to populate a DHuS instance with the data stored on the rolling archive of another DHuS instance. The DHuS instance that contains the data to be synchronized is called ?back end? instance, while the one that shall receive the data is called ?front end? instance. In case the rolling archive of the BE contains some products that are not present in the FE, once the synchronization is running, the metadata of the products present in the BE instance that are not in the database of the FE instance will be mirrored.
</P>
<p align="justify"> 
Preconditions

The FE/BE instances should be configured as follows:
BE: DHuS instance with no quota limitation and having a user with the ?archive management? function enabled.
FE: having the synchronization functionality enabled, meaning that the dhus.xml of the FE shall contain the following setting:
BE and FE shall have the incoming folders in the same filesystem
The OData Synchronizers panel allows the creation and update of synchronizers among two or more DHuS instances.

<b>Statistics</b>
<p align="justify"> 
The Statistic panel provided by DHuS allows monitoring the activities and connections handled by the software during a certain time-span. To enable these functions, it is necessary to insert in the start.sh the following line:</p>

-Daction.record.inactive=false \
