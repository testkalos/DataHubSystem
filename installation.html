								<p>nstallation Guide
The DHuS is a web application, running within a Java Virtual Machine. All its middleware components, such as database and application servers, run inside the JVM container.

In order to allow integration into a hosting environment, the application needs to be installed and configured having well in mind what are the external interfaces to be used.

The application needs to manage two flows:
the incoming flow: during the products ingestion process, the DHuS SW picks up products (compressed or not) from a folder and move them into another folder. We will call those folders, respectively, inbox and incoming.
the outgoing flow (how external users can search and download published data): this can happen using http (Tomcat) and, in particular cases, also ftp (service started by DHuS) on some dedicated service ports.


Principal DHuS Software Functionality
The filesystems used by the application, can be two or more;

one filesystem is needed for storing the DB where the products are indexed, along with the logs and application binaries. This filesystem needs to reside on the local disks.
one or more filesystems are used for archiving the products.
Given the volume of normal Sentinels production, it is also recommended to use an external disk for mounting the second filesystem, in order to cope with several TBs of products.
