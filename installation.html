  <p> <b> Installation and setup</b> 
 <!-- 
1. Create a user named ‘dhus’. Every step in the installation procedure, if not explicitly mentioned, shall be performed as dhus user.
2. Create the installation folder mkdir –p [installation-folder] mkdir –p 0.xx.x-x
3. Download the DHuS shar package here (or alternatively See How to Build Section to create the distribution package) and save it into the installation folder
4. Change the permissions on the file. chmod +x dhus-XX.XX.XX.shar
5. Launch ./dhus-0.xx.x-x .shar
(the package will autoinstall).Once executed, the system setting configuration file can be accessed and updated.
6. Once the autoinstall procedure is complete, create the following directories for the local archive, the incoming products, the database etc..:
7. mkdir -p data-local
8. mkdir -p incoming
9. mkdir – p var
Note that the incoming and the Local archive shall be two different folders (e.g. one cannot contain the other and vice versa) not necessarily under the DHuS installation folder. Moreover they shall be located in a partition of the machine where there is a certain amount of space , especially for the incoming folder (the data managed by DHuS will be located here).
Software Configuration Manual
Once the autoinstall procedure is complete the installation folder will include:
-Start.sh
-Stop.sh
-Restart.sh
start.sh
The start.sh script contains the single startup command for the DHuS.
Main parameters are : Xms and Xmx
These refer to memory allocation. We suggest to set the

Xms:1 g
Xmx:2 g
Save the file.
DHuS configuration files are contained in the etc folder created after the launch of the .shar installation package:
dhus.xml
server.xml
log4j2.xml
Dhus.xml
1.Set the var Folder path
<!ENTITY varFolder "/home/dhus/dhus-0.xx.x-x /var/">
2.Set the incoming Folder path: <incoming path="/home/dhus/dhus-0.xx.x-x /incoming" maxFileNo="10" />
3.Save the file
Server. Xml
The server.xml file contains the Apache Tomcat configuration settings. Please note that:

<Connector port="8080" indicates the http service port to setup: the default value is "8080" <Host name="localhost" This parameter indicates the server hostname.
1.Set the connect port: free number
2.<Connector port="8589"
3.Save the file
Configuration done…and now?
Once you make sure that all the parameters are set correctly, allow start.sh script to be executable:
chmod ug+x start.sh Installation Start the new DHuS version:
nohup /bin/bash start.sh &> logs.txt &
Lunch web browser:
http://localhost:8589
and… DHuS Starts!!!!!!

Login:

root
rootpassword  -->
