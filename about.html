The Data Hub is a Java web based system designed to manage the on-line dissemination of Earth Observation Satellites data.

Data Hub System V. 0.12.5-6-osf published here is developed by a Serco and Gael Systems consortium under a contract (n.4000116830/16/I-BG) with the European Space Agency in the frame of the Copernicus Programme.
The software code is made available according to the GNU Affero General Public License.

This Data Hub System version supports the dissemination of the ESA Copernicus Sentinels data access.
It provides a basic web Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow interactive data discovery and download, and a powerful Application Programming Interface (API) that allows users to access the data via their own computer programs, scripts or client applications.
                        </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Detailed information on Sentinels products and Data Access mechanisms is available at <a href="https://scihub.copernicus.eu/">https://scihub.copernicus.eu/</a></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Sentinels products can be freely downloaded at <a href="https://scihub.copernicus.eu/">https://scihub.copernicus.eu/</a>
                        </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
The software version being published is the one in operations for the dissemination of Sentinel-1A, Sentinel 2A and Sentinel-3A data at
<a href="https://scihub.copernicus.eu/">https://scihub.copernicus.eu/</a></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">

Any interested users can download and build the code, although they must be informed that no specific software maintenance is ensured for this public distribution.

However, in the future, updated DHuS system releases will be published including new functions, correcting issues and supporting the future Sentinel products, when qualified.
