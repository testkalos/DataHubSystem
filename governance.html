							<h2>Governance Model</h2>
						</header>
<p align="JUSTIFY">      
The governance model describes the roles that project participants can take on, the communication and decision making processes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">  
<h3><strong> Overview </strong><h3>
The governance model ensures that the DHuS OSF project is developed in a structured and transparent way. The following roles and processes have been adopted to strike a balance between encouraging anyone to make a contribution at any time and maintaining a high level of quality in the software.
In addition, it describes the basic rules for participation in the project and the processes for communicating and sharing within the project team and community. In other words it is the governance model that regulates an open source project.

<h3><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong><h3></p>
<p  align="JUSTIFY">  
The goal of this section is to make it clear who manage the project, who can contribute, how they may contribute, and how they should behave if they wish to directly influence the project.
There are quite a few ways to participate in the DHuS OSF project and community, and not all of them involve contributing source code to the project. Simply participating filing bug reports or enhancement requests is an incredibly valuable form of participation.
A widely used model for depicting the roles of Open Source project is the so-called onion model.
The “onion-model” diagram below shows the main roles. These are divided in two main categories:
1. Defined roles: are set by default as Management Board, Design Authority, Maintainers, and Release Manager. In the diagram below they are represented by circles in continuous line.
2. Open Roles: are available and open to all. They are Developers and Users. In the diagram below they are represented by circles in dashed line.

In the picture this difference is highlighted respectively with dashed lines and continuous lines. At the heart of Open Source DHuS community is the Management Board, who makes strategic decisions defined in the Roadmap. In the next onion layer is the Design Authority, a group of core members that coordinate the project deciding on technical policies.
The next onion layer consists of Maintainers and Release Manager.
Maintainers regularly merge contributors’ patches, bug fixes and new code.
Release Manager supervises the overall release process management.
Developers contribute to the source code, web site content, FAQs, screenshots, documentation.
The outmost onion layer consists of users, who do not actively participate in the development, but who download and use the software. Users are the largest group.
As said, the open roles are not static for example a user may at one point become a developer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<h4><strong>2.1 Management Board</strong></h4>
<p  align="JUSTIFY">
Management board authorizes program and makes strategic decisions about community processes.
It is the management board's job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community's job to guide the decisions of the management board through active engagement and contribution.
Management board sets the strategic objectives of the project and communicates these clearly to the community. It also has to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project survives in the long term.
The key is to ensure that, as the project expands, the right people are given influence over it and the community rallies behind its vision. 
How to become one: is self-appointed.
</p>

<h4><strong>2.2	Design Authority </strong></h4>
<p  align="JUSTIFY">
Design Authority decides on technical policies for the project as package selection, packaging policy, installation systems and processes, components, dependencies. 
Design authority has made several valuable contributions to the project and is relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others.
It is a design authority’s job to be aware of the community’s needs and collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Design authority gives control over specific areas of responsibility, and assigns rights to directly modify certain areas of the source code to other roles. 
How to become one: Be appointed by the Management Board.
</p>
<h4><strong>2.3	Maintainers</strong></h4>
They are responsible for merging contributors’ patches, bug fixes, and new code from the development branch of the source tree into the stable branch. Maintainers are responsible for making sure that these contributions do not break the build. 
A Maintainer is responsible for his module (by having access to the source tree), and for granting check-in privileges to developers. They also act as the “gatekeeper” of the module, helping to ensure quality across the build. Typically, a maintainer will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community. 
How to become one: Be appointed by the Design authority. 
<h4><strong>2.4	Release Manager</strong></h4>
	
<p  align="JUSTIFY">
The Release Manager is responsible for the overall release process. In addition to making sure that releases are planned correctly and completed on schedule. 
Release manager takes care of shepherding a release from an initial community consensus to make it to final distribution. 
He makes the release candidate available for testing. Every release should be tested on as many platforms and by as many users as possible.
The source code and build process must comply with the legal and intellectual property requirements for a valid release, and the project must have the infrastructure in place to correctly sign the release artefacts.
