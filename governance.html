							<h2>Governance Model</h2>
						</header>
<p align="JUSTIFY">      
The governance model describes the roles that project participants can take on, the communication and decision making processes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">  
<h3><strong> Overview </strong><h3>
The governance model ensures that the DHuS OSF project is developed in a structured and transparent way. The following roles and processes have been adopted to strike a balance between encouraging anyone to make a contribution at any time and maintaining a high level of quality in the software.
In addition, it describes the basic rules for participation in the project and the processes for communicating and sharing within the project team and community. In other words it is the governance model that regulates an open source project.

<h3><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong><h3>
The goal of this section is to make it clear who manage the project, who can contribute, how they may contribute, and how they should behave if they wish to directly influence the project.
There are quite a few ways to participate in the DHuS OSF project and community, and not all of them involve contributing source code to the project. Simply participating filing bug reports or enhancement requests is an incredibly valuable form of participation.
A widely used model for depicting the roles of Open Source project is the so-called onion model.
The “onion-model” diagram below shows the main roles. These are divided in two main categories:
1. Defined roles: are set by default as Management Board, Design Authority, Maintainers, and Release Manager. In the diagram below they are represented by circles in continuous line.
2. Open Roles: are available and open to all. They are Developers and Users. In the diagram below they are represented by circles in dashed line.
</p>

In the picture this difference is highlighted respectively with dashed lines and continuous lines. At the heart of Open Source DHuS community is the Management Board, who makes strategic decisions defined in the Roadmap. In the next onion layer is the Design Authority, a group of core members that coordinate the project deciding on technical policies.
The next onion layer consists of Maintainers and Release Manager.
Maintainers regularly merge contributors’ patches, bug fixes and new code.
Release Manager supervises the overall release process management.
Developers contribute to the source code, web site content, FAQs, screenshots, documentation.
The outmost onion layer consists of users, who do not actively participate in the development, but who download and use the software. Users are the largest group.
As said, the open roles are not static for example a user may at one point become a developer.

2.1 Management Board
Management board authorizes program and makes strategic decisions about community processes.
It is the management board's job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community's job to guide the decisions of the management board through active engagement and contribution.
Management board sets the strategic objectives of the project and communicates these clearly to the community. It also has to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project survives in the long term.
