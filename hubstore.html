							<h3>Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP)</h3>
							<p>A common architecture for all Sentinel Toolboxes is being jointly developed by Brockmann Consult, Array Systems Computing and C-S called the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP).
The SNAP architecture is ideal for Earth Observation processing and analysis due the following technological innovations: Extensibility, Portability, Modular Rich Client Platform, Generic EO Data Abstraction, Tiled Memory Management, and a Graph Processing Framework.

							<h3>Sentinel-1 Toolbox </h3>
							<p>The Sentinel-1 Toolbox (S1TBX) consists of a collection of processing tools, data product readers and writers and a display and analysis application to support the large archive of data from ESA SAR missions including SENTINEL-1, ERS-1 & 2 and ENVISAT, as well as third party SAR data from ALOS PALSAR, TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed and RADARSAT-2. The various processing tools could be run independently from the command-line and also integrated within the graphical user interface. The Toolbox includes tools for calibration, speckle filtering, coregistration, orthorectification, mosaicking, data conversion, polarimetry and interferometry.
The Sentinel-1 Toolbox is being developed for ESA by Array Systems Computing in partnership with DLR, Brockmann Consult and OceanDataLab. </p>

							<h3>Sentinel-2 Toolbox</h3>
							<p>The Sentinel-2 Toolbox consists of a rich set of visualisation, analysis and processing tools for the exploitation of optical high-resolution products including the upcoming Sentinel-2 MSI sensor. As a multi-mission remote sensing toolbox, it also provides support for third party data from RapidEye, SPOT, MODIS (Aqua and Terra), Landsat (TM) and others.
The Sentinel-2 Toolbox is being developed for ESA by CS in partnership with Brockmann Consult, CS ROMANIA, Telespazio Vega Deutschland, INRA and UCL.  </p>

							<h3> Sentinel-3 Toolbox </h3>
							<p> The Sentinel-3 Toolbox consists of a rich set of visualisation, analysis and processing tools for the exploitation of OLCI and SLSTR data from the upcoming Sentinel-3 mission. As a multi-mission remote sensing toolbox, it also supports the ESA missions Envisat (MERIS & AATSR), ERS (ATSR), SMOS as well as third party data from MODIS (Aqua and Terra), Landsat (TM), ALOS (AVNIR & PRISM) and others. The various tools can be run from an intuitive desktop application or via a command-line interface. A rich application programming interface allows for development of plugins using Java or Python.

The Sentinel-3 Toolbox is being developed for ESA by Brockmann Consult in partnership with the University of Reading, C-S France, ACRI-ST and Array.
